# Sponsor Street Side Software

As the founder of Street Side Software, I would like to thank you for visiting.

## History of CSpell

Years ago I created the [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension for VS Code because I wanted to avoid spelling mistakes that detracted from my work. I'm good at many things, but spelling isn't one of them. Since I have worked around many coders, web designers, engineers, and product managers, I know I'm not the only one. My goal was to get things done and not have to worry about spelling.

An early request was to create a command line tool ([CSpell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell)) that could be used outside of the extension as part of the CI/CD process. It has become clear that many others found it useful, since [CSpell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell) has become the defacto spell checker for CI/CD processes. It is used by corporations like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Siemens to spell check documentation, source code, and more. It is used by schools, universities, and code academies when accepting coding assignments. With over 11 million installs, the [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension has also grown in popularity. Language support has added to include French, German, Spanish, and more, even Esperanto. Which was only possible because the dictionaries were Open Source.

## Commitment to Open Source

It was a conscious choice from the beginning to Open Source the spell checker.

## Commitment to Data Privacy and Security



## Sponsorship

Let's start with a few questions:

- Does the spell checker help you get things done?
- Does the spell checker help improve the quality of your work?
- Is avoiding spelling mistakes important to you or your team?
- Do you have ideas on how it could be better?

In order to dedicate resources to maintaining and improving the CSpell suite of tools, Street Side Software needs your support.
