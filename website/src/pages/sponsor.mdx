## Sponsorship

Let's start with a few questions:

-   Does the spell checker help you get things done?
-   Does the spell checker help improve the quality of your work?
-   Is avoiding spelling mistakes important to you or your team?
-   Do you have ideas on how it could be better?

In order to dedicate resources to maintaining and improving the CSpell suite of tools, Street Side Software needs your support.
